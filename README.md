###### A multi-platform 200 card game.


Game Information
----------------
This is popular Canadian card game made up of two teams of two players. Each round, players bid on the amount of points
they believe they can get, and the highest bidding team must hit their mark or that value is subtracted from their overall
game points. Several rounds are played until one team has reached 200 points.
(See more information here: http://www.pagat.com/kt5/200.html).

Platform
--------
This application will target multiple platforms using the Kivy Python framework (kivy.org). The intent is to have a
distribution for iOS and Android, as well as OSX, Windows, and Linux, with all dists using the same multiplayer
interface.

Technologies
------------
The back-end will be Python (2.7), as well as the front-end on the platforms that will use Kivy builds. There may be a
javascript web client eventually.

Developers
----------
Just me for now. Send questions and comments to Dave <zimmed@zimmed.io>.
